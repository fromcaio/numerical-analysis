# üìö Numerical Analysis: Theory, Visualizations, and Python Implementations

This repository features a collection of **Jupyter Notebooks** (`.ipynb`) created during my **Numerical Analysis** course as an undergraduate Computer Science student.

The main goal is to explain fundamental Numerical Analysis methods through a hands-on, practical approach. Each notebook is designed to combine:

* **Theoretical Explanation**: Foundational concepts behind the numerical methods.
* **Graphs and Visualizations**: Illustrations of convergence, function behavior, and errors.
* **Python Code**: Clear, didactic implementation of the algorithms.

## üìñ Reference Material

The content structure and theoretical basis are primarily drawn from the Brazilian textbook:

**C√°lculo Num√©rico: Aspectos Te√≥ricos e Computacionais** (Numerical Calculus: Theoretical and Computational Aspects)
* **Authors**: M√°rcia A. Gomes Ruggiero and Vera L√∫cia da Rocha Lopes

## üìù Repository Content Structure

The repository chapters follow the book's outline, covering key topics in Numerical Analysis:

| Chapter | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Basic Notions of Errors |
| **2** | Real Zeros of Real Functions |
| **3** | Resolution of Linear Systems |
| **4** | Introduction to the Resolution of Non-Linear Systems |
| **5** | Interpolation |
| **6** | Curve Fitting by the Least Squares Method |
| **7** | Numerical Integration |
| **8** | Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations: Initial and Boundary Value Problems |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The notebooks are implemented in **Python** and rely on standard libraries for scientific computing:

* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* **Core Libraries:**
    * `NumPy`: For efficient array/vector manipulation and mathematical operations.
    * `Matplotlib`: For generating plots and visualizing method results.
    * `Pandas`: For data handling and displaying results in a tabular format.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the examples and run the code locally, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed.
