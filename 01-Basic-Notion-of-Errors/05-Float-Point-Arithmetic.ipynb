    "In standard mathematics with real numbers, we take certain properties for granted. For example, the order in which we add numbers doesn't change the result (associativity), and multiplication distributes over addition. However, in the world of computer-based floating-point arithmetic, these rules can be broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because computers store numbers with finite precision, every operation is a potential source of a small rounding error. When many operations are performed, these small errors can accumulate and lead to significant inaccuracies. More surprisingly, the **order of operations** can dramatically change the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate that for floating-point numbers:\n",
    "- **Associativity of addition is not guaranteed**:  `(a + b) + c` is not always equal to `a + (b + c)`\n",
    "- **Distributivity is not guaranteed**: `a * (b + c)` is not always equal to `a * b + a * c`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze these properties by simulating a simple floating-point system and using absolute and relative errors to see which order of operations yields a better result."

    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Arithmetic rules for real numbers do not always apply to floating-point numbers.** Properties like associativity and distributivity can fail due to rounding after each operation.\n",
    "2.  **The order of operations is critical for numerical accuracy.** As demonstrated, changing the order can lead to very different results and errors.\n",
    "3.  **Beware of Catastrophic Cancellation.** Subtracting two nearly equal floating-point numbers is one of the most common sources of severe numerical error. If possible, algebraic expressions should be rearranged to avoid this situation."
