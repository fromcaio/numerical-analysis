    "# Notions of Errors: Absolute and Relative Error\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous notebooks, we established that errors are an unavoidable part of numerical computation. However, simply knowing that an error exists is not enough. We need ways to **quantify** its magnitude and understand its **significance**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, is an error of 1 centimeter a big deal? If you are measuring the length of a pencil, yes. If you are measuring the distance between SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the concepts of **absolute error** and **relative error** become essential. They are the fundamental tools we use to measure the discrepancy between an approximated value and a true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "* Define absolute and relative error.\n",
    "* Discuss why relative error is often a more meaningful measure of an error's importance.\n",
    "* Provide clear Python examples to illustrate these concepts."

    "\n",
    "Let's establish our notation:\n",
    "-   Let $ x $ be the exact or true value of a quantity.\n",
    "-   Let $ \\bar{x} $ be the approximate or measured value of that quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Absolute Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The **absolute error** ($E_a$) is the absolute difference between the true value and the approximate value. It tells you the raw magnitude of the discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "$$ E_a = |x - \\bar{x}| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** The absolute error does not provide context. As we saw in the introduction, an absolute error of 1 cm is large for a small object but negligible for a large one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Relative Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The **relative error** ($E_r$) is the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the true value. It expresses the error as a fraction or percentage of the true value, which gives us a much better sense of its significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "$$ E_r = \\frac{|x - \\bar{x}|}{|x|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** This formula assumes that $ x \\neq 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative error is often expressed as a percentage by multiplying it by 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_r(\\%) = \\frac{|x - \\bar{x}|}{|x|} \\times 100\\% $$"

    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Absolute Error** measures the raw difference between a true and an approximate value but lacks context about the error's importance.\n",
    "2.  **Relative Error** scales the error against the true value, making it a much better indicator of the error's significance.\n",
    "3.  In almost all scientific and engineering contexts, the **relative error is the more informative and useful metric** for evaluating the quality of an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter an error in a numerical method, always consider calculating the relative error to determine if the approximation is \"good enough\" for your specific application."
