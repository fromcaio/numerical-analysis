    "### Justification and Comparison of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "- **Case (a) with $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ converges extremely quickly**, achieving high precision in just 3 iterations.\n",
    "- **Case (b) with $f(x) = \\cos(x) + 1$ converges very slowly**, requiring 19 iterations to reach a similar, but less accurate, precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in performance is due to the nature of the root at $x=\\pi$ for each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **For $f_1(x) = \\sin(x)$:**\n",
    "    - The root at $x=\\pi$ is a **simple root**. \n",
    "    - The derivative at the root is non-zero: $f_1'(\\pi) = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n",
    "    - When the derivative at the root is non-zero, Newton's method exhibits **quadratic convergence**, which is exceptionally fast. The number of correct digits roughly doubles with each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **For $f_2(x) = \\cos(x) + 1$:**\n",
    "    - The root at $x=\\pi$ is a **multiple root** (specifically, a double root).\n",
    "    - The derivative at the root is **zero**: $f_2'(\\pi) = -\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n",
    "    - When the derivative at the root is zero, the fundamental assumption of Newton's method is violated. The method loses its quadratic convergence property and reverts to **linear convergence**, which is much slower.\n",
    "    - We can see from the table for Case (b) that the derivative $f'(x_k)$ gets closer and closer to zero as $x_k$ approaches $\\pi$, which slows down the process dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a perfect illustration of how the theoretical properties of a function at its root directly impact the performance of Newton's method. The method is at its best for simple roots where the function has a steep, non-zero slope. It struggles significantly when the root is also a critical point (i.e., where the tangent is horizontal)."
