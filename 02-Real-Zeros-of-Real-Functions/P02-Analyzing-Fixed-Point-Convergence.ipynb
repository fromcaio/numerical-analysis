    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the sequence of approximations, we can draw several conclusions about the root and the convergence behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Observation of Convergence\n",
    "The values of $x_k$ are clearly converging. After some initial large changes (from $x_{10}$ to $x_{11}$), the approximations begin to settle down. The last few iterations show the values getting progressively closer:\n",
    "- $x_{16} = 2.14133$\n",
    "- $x_{17} = 2.14147$\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the true root, let's call it $r$, must lie between these last two values:\n",
    "$$ 2.14133 \\le r \\le 2.14147 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A good estimate for the root would be the midpoint of this final interval:\n",
    "$$ r \\approx \\frac{2.14133 + 2.14147}{2} = 2.1414 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Estimating the Error\n",
    "For a converging sequence, the absolute error of the last approximation, $|r - x_{17}|$, can be bounded by the magnitude of the last step, $|x_{17} - x_{16}|$.\n",
    "$$ |r - x_{17}| \\le |x_{17} - x_{16}| = |2.14147 - 2.14133| = 0.00014 $$\n",
    "So, we can say that the approximation $x_{17} = 2.14147$ is correct with an error of at most $1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Characterizing the Convergence (Advanced)\n",
    "We can also observe the *type* of convergence. Notice how the approximations oscillate around the final value:\n",
    "- $x_{13} = 2.14159$ (high)\n",
    "- $x_{14} = 2.14128$ (low)\n",
    "- $x_{15} = 2.14151$ (high)\n",
    "- $x_{16} = 2.14133$ (low)\n",
    "- $x_{17} = 2.14147$ (high)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is called **oscillatory convergence**. In the context of the Fixed-Point Theorem, this happens when the derivative of the iteration function, $g'(r)$, is **negative** (specifically, $-1 < g'(r) < 0$). This causes the iterations to jump from one side of the root to the other, as seen in a \"cobweb\" plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the provided data, we can conclude:\n",
    "1.  The method is **converging**.\n",
    "2.  The root is approximately **$r \\approx 2.1414$**.\n",
    "3.  The approximation is accurate to at least 3 decimal places, with an error less than $1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n",
    "4.  The convergence is **oscillatory**, which implies that for the chosen iteration function $g(x)$, its derivative at the root is negative."
