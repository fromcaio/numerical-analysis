    "The bisection method can be applied whenever $f(a) \\cdot f(b) < 0$. This condition holds even if there is more than one root in the interval $(a, b)$.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $f(a) \\cdot f(b) < 0$ guarantees that there is an **odd number of roots** within the interval $(a, b)$. The Bisection Method is guaranteed to converge to **one** of these roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, without further information, it is **not possible to predict with certainty** which of the roots will be found. The outcome depends on the function's behavior and the precise locations of the roots relative to the midpoints calculated at each step.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment demonstrates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Bisection Method still works**: The condition $f(a)f(b) < 0$ is sufficient to guarantee convergence to *a* root, even if the interval contains multiple roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The specific root found depends on the starting interval**: The experiment clearly shows how the choice of the initial interval `(a, b)` determines which root is found. For example:\n",
    "    - Starting with `[0, 4]`, the first midpoint is `m=2`, where `f(2)=0`. The method luckily finds the exact root and stops.\n",
    "    - Starting with `[0.5, 4]`, the midpoint is `m=2.25`. Since `f(0.5)` is negative and `f(2.25)` is positive, the new interval becomes `[0.5, 2.25]`, which contains two roots. The process continues, eventually isolating and converging to the root at `x=1.0`.\n",
    "    - Starting with `[0, 3.5]`, the midpoint is `m=1.75`. Since `f(1.75)` is positive and `f(3.5)` is positive, the new interval becomes `[0, 1.75]`, which contains two roots. The process continues until it isolates and converges to the root at `x=1.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior, while deterministic, is not easily predictable without tracing the algorithm's steps.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Best Practice**: The most reliable way to use the bisection method is to first perform a graphical or tabular analysis to find smaller intervals that **isolate a single root**. Applying the method to these smaller, well-defined brackets ensures you find the specific root you are looking for."
